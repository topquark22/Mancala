# Mancala
The Mancala "board" is made up of two rows of six holes, or pits, each.
Each player has a "store" ("calah") to his right side of the board.

Four pieces (marbles, stones or beans) are placed in each of the 12
holes. The colour of the pieces is irrelevant.

A move consists of one player picking up all of the pieces in any one
of the holes on his side. Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits
one of the stones in each hole until the stones run out.

If you run into your own store, deposit one piece in it. If you run
into your opponent's store, skip it.

If the last piece you drop is in your own store, you get a free turn.

If the last piece you drop is in an empty hole on your side and there
are pieces in the hole directly opposite, you capture that piece and
any pieces in the hole directly opposite. Place all captured pieces
(along with the piece making the capture) in your store, and take
another move.

The game ends when all six spaces on one side of the Mancala board
are empty.

The player who still has pieces on his side of the board when the
game ends captures all of those pieces.

The winner is the player with the most pieces in his store.
