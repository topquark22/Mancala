# Project Proposal - ContractHub - June 2023

_There is no try. Only do, or do not._ Yoda

## Preamble

As of this writing, recent developments in Artificial Intelligence have made it possible to automate many facets of software development. We envision a world in which software is primarily generated by AI. This does not mean that human expert developers will disappear, but their role will shift into primarily code review, testing and validation. Our vision aims to be one of the first pioneers to step into this new methodology.

## Business Overview

The goal of ContractHub is to provide a streamlined and efficient solution for Clients (customers) looking to implement and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum. By combining the interpretive powers of AI with the robust infrastructure of Ethereum, we aim to provide an unparalleled service that creates, tests and and reviews contracts based on the specific needs of each customer.

Our unique solution will amalgamate AI capabilities with Ethereum smart contract development. By using ChatGPT's natural language processing capabilities, we will create a system that can interpret customer requirements in natural language, validate, and reduce smart contract generation times.

In addition, we will use the AI to generate Unit Test cases, based on the use cases in the customer's requirement specifications, and rigorously test each use case using Mock Objects.

 A User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase will then commence to allow the Client to review, modify requirements, and sign off on the work before anything is deployed to the blockchain.

## 2. Technical Goals

- Develop a Solidity contract generator to create an automated automated contract drafting system. It will continuously interface with ChatGPT-x in a convergent process of generation, testing of the results, feedback to the AI, and review.
- Following UAT review and approval by the Client, interface with Ethereum blockchain infrastructure via APIs to deploy contracts.

## 3. Technology Stack

Our primary technology stack will include Python, Ethereum blockchain via Web3.py (Python library for Ethereum), OpenAI's ChatGPT-x API for natural language processing, and pytest for testing.

Depending on scale, Docker and Kubernetes may or may not be used for containerization and orchestration respectively, and Jenkins for continuous integration.

## 4. System Architecture

The system will interface with Ethereum blockchain for transactions and contract deployment, and an AI component that leverages GPT-4 to analyze and interpret user requirements. These requirements will be used to generate draft smart contracts in Solidity.

## 5. Security and Privacy

We will adhere to Ethereum's security best practices for smart contracts and employ data encryption to secure user data. Privacy regulations will be strictly enforced, and ChatGPT-4's outputs will be carefully managed to avoid any data leaks.

## 6. Development Methodology

We will follow Agile methodology, including iterative two-week sprints, daily standups, and sprint retrospectives. CI pipelines will be managed using Jenkins.

## 7. Testing and Validation

Our testing approach of our code will comprise unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests using pytest.

## 8. Resource Plan

The project will require a multidisciplinary team of Ethereum developers, Python developers, AI experts, QA testers, and DevOps engineers. Additionally, computational resources for AI model interactions will be required.

## 9. Risk Mitigation Strategy

Potential risks such as data breaches, system failures, or project delays will be monitored and backup plans maintained. An important risk specific to our project is the potential for errors in the automated generation of smart contracts, which could have financial implications. To mitigate this, the deployment of smart contracts will be handled manually by experienced Solidity developers to prevent potential errors leading to financial risk. A buffer in the timeline will be kept for unexpected contingencies.

## 10. Project Timeline

Our tentative timeline is: research and planning (1 month), development of GPT-4 and Solidity contract generator components (3 months), integration (1 month), testing and validation including UAT phase (1 month), and final deployment (1 month).

## 11. Knowledge Transfer and Training

Regular knowledge sharing and training sessions will be arranged to keep the team updated with the latest advancements in Ethereum blockchain, Python, and GPT-4. Workshops on secure coding practices and efficient tool usage will be held.

By integrating Ethereum blockchain and ChatGPT-4, ContractHub paves the way for a revolution in contract management, creating a system that interprets user needs and drafts contracts in an efficient and user-friendly manner.
